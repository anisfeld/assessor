            <h3 class="title"> Cook County Market Value Ratios 2009-2015 for Single-family Homes and Condos</h3>

              
                  <p>Cook County Assessor Joe Berrios's job is to estimate the value of property
                  in the county so that taxes can be levied in proportion to property values.
                  Using data from 2009 to 2015 (2015 is the latest year it is available), we
                  checked to see whether he did his job well. </p>

                  <p>The results are in: Berrios produced poor quality, unfair assessments.
                  Berrios's bad assessments shifted taxes away from high value properties and
                  onto lower value properties. In effect, Berrios made poorer residents in
                  Cook County pay part of the tax bills of richer residents in Cook County. In
                  many cases, taxpayers paid hundreds of dollars more in property taxes than
                  they would have had Berrios done his job well.</p>

                  <p>This map confirms what 
                  <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/taxdivide/">The Chicago Tribune</a> , 
                  <a href = "https://www.propublica.org/series/the-tax-divide"> ProPublica</a>, and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/n3ze4t0d612dsgn/Ross%20-%20Vertical%20Equity%20in
                  %20Cook%20County%20-%20CMF%20-%20Final.pdf?dl=0">The University of
                  Chicago </a> have already told us - Joe
                  Berrios produce bad and unfair assessments. Here, we map the ratio of
                  Berrios's estimate of home values to the sale price of homes, in the year
                  they sold. A ratio of 1 shows that the Berrios's estimate was exactly equal
                  to the sale price of the home. A ratio greater than 1 shows that Berrios
                  over-estimated the value of a home, and therefore the home paid more taxes
                  than they should have. Conversely, a ratio less than 1 shows that Berrios
                  under-estimated properties' values, leading to lower tax bills for those
                  properties. It is important to remember that under-value properties are not
                  simply taxed less, they shift their unpaid amounts to the over-valued
                  properties. </p>

                  <p>In the map, lighter colors have lower market value ratios. Clearly, Berrios
                  consistently valued north and central Chicago properties lower than western
                  and southern properties. This produced unfair shifting of taxes from
                  high-value, mostly white areas of the county to lower-value, mostly minority
                  areas of the county. Joe Berrios has clearly failed to perform the central
                  duties of his office. His failures as an assessor have unnecessarily and
                  unfairly increased taxes for minority and low-income residents in this
                  County. </p>

                  <p>Cook County deserves a competent, fair assessor. </p>
