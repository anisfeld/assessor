            <h3 class="title"> Cook County Market Value Ratios 2009-2015 for Single-family Homes and Condos</h3>

              
              <p> Cook County Assessor Joe Berrios's job is to estimate the value of property in the county so that taxes can be levied in proportion to property values. Using data from 2009 to 2015 (2015 is the latest year it is available), we confirmed what <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/taxdivide/">The Chicago Tribune</a> , 
              <a href = "https://www.propublica.org/series/the-tax-divide"> ProPublica<a>, and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/n3ze4t0d612dsgn/Ross%20-%20Vertical%20Equity%20in
              %20Cook%20County%20-%20CMF%20-%20Final.pdf?dl=0">The University of
              Chicago </a> have already told us - Joe Berrios produce bad and unfair assessments. Here, we map the ratio of Berrios's estimate of home values to the sale price of homes, in the year they sold. </p>

              <h2> How to Read the Map </h2>

              <p>When you hover over a community area on the map you will see ratios for residential property taxes.</p> 

              <ul>
              <li>A ratio of 1.0 means that Joe Berrios' assessment was exactly equal to the sales price of the home. </li>
              <br>
              <li> A ratio of greater than 1, such as 1.21 indicates that Joe Berrios over estimated the value of the home meaning that the homeowner here paid more in taxes than they should have. </li>
              <br>
              <li> A ratio of less than 1, such as .879 means that homeowner paid lower tax bills for those properties. It is important to remember that under-value properties are not simply taxed less, they shift their unpaid amounts to the over-valued properties. </li>
              </ul>

              <p>In the map, lighter colors have lower market value ratios demonstrating the structural racism that Berrios' assessments reflect because Chicago is one of the most segregated cities in America. By consistently valuing north and central Chicago properties lower than western and southern properties Berrios is shifting of taxes from high-value, mostly white areas of the county to lower-value, mostly minority areas of the county. </p>

              <p> Berrios' bad assessments have systematically shifted taxes away from high value properties and onto lower value properties. In effect, Berrios made poorer residents in Cook County pay part of the tax bills of richer residents in Cook County. In many cases, taxpayers paid hundreds of dollars more in property taxes than they would have had Berrios done his job well. What we have not included here are commerical property valuations, such as the Trump Tower deal, which shifts hundreds of millions of dollars off of corporations and on to all residential property owners no matter what their income, race or area in which they live. </p>

              <p>Cook County deserves a competent, fair assessor, who will deliver a transparent, unbiased and accurate set of assessments. That person is Fritz Kaegi.
